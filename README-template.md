## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project working Mobile-first. It was also just a lot more practice with Flexbox. I still ran into some complications but worked through them with some advice from the Slack community. 

### Continued development

I still just need to keep working with Flexbox and really getting to understand the behaviors and functions. 

### Useful resources

The Frontend Mentor Slack community has been priceless for my learning.
